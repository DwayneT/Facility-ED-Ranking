Ranking Kenyan Emergency Departments to enhance stakeholder engagement.

## Introduction
Ranking Kenyan Emergency Departments is crucial for providing valuable insights to healthcare stakeholders, policymakers, and the public. This repository contains code and data analysis tools used to gather relevant information and rank emergency departments from the best to the worst in Kenya.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:
- To collect comprehensive data on each emergency department, including infrastructure, staffing levels, equipment availability, and service capabilities.
- To define key performance indicators (KPIs) such as patient wait times, door-to-provider times, and treatment times.
- To assess the availability of medical resources, evaluate the physical infrastructure, and engage with stakeholders to gather insights into operational challenges and opportunities for improvement.
- To develop a transparent and evidence-based ranking methodology that considers multiple dimensions of emergency care quality and accessibility.

## Methodology
The project involves several complex tasks, including:
1. **Data Collection:** Comprehensive data on each emergency department is collected, covering various aspects such as infrastructure, staffing, patient volumes, and outcomes.
2. **Performance Metrics:** Key performance indicators (KPIs) are defined and data is collected on patient satisfaction, quality of care, mortality rates, and more.
3. **Resource Assessment:** The availability of medical resources, essential medications, and staffing levels are evaluated to ensure efficient emergency care delivery.
4. **Infrastructure Evaluation:** The physical infrastructure of each emergency department is assessed, considering factors such as facility size, equipment condition, and utilities.
5. **Stakeholder Engagement:** Engagement with emergency department staff, patients, caregivers, and other stakeholders is crucial for gathering insights and feedback.
6. **Data Analysis and Interpretation:** Collected data is analyzed using statistical methods and data visualization techniques to identify trends, patterns, and disparities among emergency departments.
7. **Ranking Methodology:** A transparent and evidence-based ranking methodology is developed, considering various performance metrics and factors relevant to emergency care quality and accessibility.

## Tools Used
- **Python Libraries:** This project utilizes Python programming language along with essential libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
- **API Access:** The project accesses data from the [Kenya Master Health Facility List (KMHFL) API](https://kmhfl.health.go.ke/#/home) to gather information on emergency departments in Kenya. This involves utilizing Python libraries such as `requests` to interact with the API endpoints and retrieve relevant data.

## Conclusion
By undertaking these complex tasks and utilizing advanced data analysis tools, stakeholders can gain a comprehensive understanding of emergency department performance in Kenya. This project aims to contribute to efforts aimed at improving emergency care quality and access nationwide.
